# python-ga
first python project: simple genetic algorithm


###next todo:

* need to add random mutation to children

* need to store average and maximum fitness for each generation to be able to compare

* need to test a bunch of stuff to make sure it all works right because so much is not really visible in the running of it


###and then, eventually.... (in future...have to move on from this for now to learn more practical things, sadly...)

* add way to interact with the program to make own adjustments (number of generations, number of actions per robot, etc)

* add lots of optional (so as not to overwhelm) statistics/info printouts

* add graphics capability eventually?  play 1 random original vs 1 random 1000th child for animated comparison 

* maybe after learning more python web stuff make it more of a web app and give it a simple html/css/js UI
