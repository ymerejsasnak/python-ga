# python-ga
first python project: simple genetic algorithm


###todo: (See book, type these up in more detail when not so tired)
*fix what is there so it is more in line with what it shoudl be
*create situation table (ie, what to do depending on n/s/e/w/c status) [seperate file, import or load or something]
*will need a view object or function or something for above, to use current space to look up strategy for that type of situation (243 total combinations (some not possible but whatever) therefore 243 possible reactions in each robot's strategy)
*method for robot to perform its search (performs 200 actions)
*run search for 200 originals
*give each fitness rating(how to score them?!?!)
*apply evolution(see book for details)
*repeat for 1000 generations and compare original ratings with 1000th decendents ratings
*eventually add way to interact with the program to make own adjustments to numbers, etc.
*add lots of statistics/info printouts
*add graphics capability eventually?  play 1 random original vs 1 random 1000th child for animated comparison (at least use curses?)
*after learning more python web stuff give it a front end and put it online?
