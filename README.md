# python-ga
first python project: simple genetic algorithm
(adapted from description in Melanie Mitchell's book "Complexity, a Guided Tour")

###note!

* just read over code and noticed the robot's position is not reset to 0,0 at the beginning of each session! (of course this may not have much effect, but it was not intended therefore should be fixed when I have more time...)


###next todo:

* need to store average and maximum fitness for each generation to be able to compare in the end

* need to test a bunch of stuff to make sure it all works right because so much is not really visible in the running of it

* add a timer...times 1 generation and estimates time remaining based on that (or similar <idea class=""></idea>)


###and then, eventually.... (in future...have to move on from this for now to learn more practical things, sadly...)

* add way to interact with the program to make own adjustments (number of generations, number of actions per robot, etc)

* add lots of optional (so as not to overwhelm) statistics/info printouts

* add graphics capability eventually?  play 1 random original vs 1 random 1000th child for animated comparison 

* maybe after learning more python web stuff make it more of a web app and give it a simple html/css/js UI
